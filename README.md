### Section one covers my desision making process for buying parts as I actually do it
For people who think its a mystery they may never solve.

First find a reason
---
	 Why are you building this machine
---
		* For work, important documents, writing, or as some say office productivity
		* For gaming, pew pew pew, real time stratagy, 
		* For web surfing, a digital hang ten

	... You could want to mix these. I mean who doesn't plan to you the internet with their computer
	... If you just go with the highest bar. If it's good enough to pay Crysis it's good enough to do anything
		..* That's a joke Crysis is a game known for it's hefty requirements

Second find money (Set a budget)
---
	... Here's some general rules that with some elbow grease and knowing a guy you could avoid but eh
		..* Gaming costs more, outside of fancy research computers this has the highest cost to do
		* You can use word on just about anything or as we tech people say "It can run on a potato"
			(A potato is a computer which has such little power processing or otherwise that we call it a potato)
		* The future is online. Companies figured out they can make more money on services then selling you something once
		* If you computer starts to slow down chances are the software has become "bloated"
			A specific component of your computer doesn't really slow down over time. See example [I'm a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JqNJq-PC0)
			Software, however, does. Every update changes the code sometimes well sometimes not, usually with new hardware in mind
			So what happens is that software is now harder for old computers to run even if it's the program is still Internet Explorer
		* Less is more, this is more a rule for software. The more programs you have in use the more power your computer needs.

	... Supprising facts
		* you can have a computer for $10 amarican dollors. If you want a computer for education, documents ect you actually don't need a lot of money
