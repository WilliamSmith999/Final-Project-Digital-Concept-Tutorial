# Picking parts & Placing Peaces
## William Smith
### Section one covers my desision making process for buying parts as I actually do it
For people who think its a mystery they may never solve.

First find a reason
---
>Why are you building this machine
>* For work, important documents, writing, or as some say office productivity
>* For gaming, pew pew pew, real time stratagy, 
>* For web surfing, a digital hang ten
>... You could want to mix these. I mean who doesn't plan to use the internet with their computer
>... If you just go with the highest bar. If it's good enough to pay Crysis it's good enough to do anything
>	* That's a joke Crysis is a game known for it's hefty requirements

Second find money (Set a budget)
---

> Here's some general rules that with some elbow grease and knowing a guy you could avoid but eh
>* Gaming costs more, outside of fancy research computers this has the highest cost to do
>* You can use word on just about anything or as we tech people say "It can run on a potato"
>	* (A potato is a computer which has such little power processing or otherwise that we call it a potato)
>* The future is online. Companies figured out they can make more money on services then selling you something once
>* If you computer starts to slow down chances are the software has become "bloated"
>	* A specific component of your computer doesn't really slow down over time. See example [I'm a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JqNJq-PC0) Software, however, does. Every update changes the code sometimes well sometimes not, usually with new hardware in mind So what happens is that software is now harder for old computers to run even if it's the program is still Internet Explorer
>* Less is more, this is more a rule for software. The more programs you have in use the more power your computer needs.

Third pick your poison, I mean parts
---
> Brand loyalty is over rated, but it can make things easier if you don't want to think to hard about it
> if all your parts are under one or two roof customer service can be a bit more knowledgeable
> [PCPARTPICKER.COM](https://pcpartpicker.com/)
> *I have assemble several computers and I still use/trust this site to make sure things fit.
> You will need at minium 
>* _ ATX tower (or mid-tower) case
>* _ Power Supply
>* _ CPU
>* _ ATX Motherboard
>* _ RAM / Memory
>* _ Graphics/video card
>* _ Cooling / Fans
>* _ Storage
> as for which brand is best or model is best
> Image for a moment you are shopping for Mac & Cheese
> Which is best is a matter of taste.
> Yes some Macs are more plastic than cheese, but if you like it that way...
> Some popular brands at the time of writting are, Asus, Asrock, and MSI
>* Personally I have used several Asus and asrock brand parts. Neither have let me down.

Fourth play with legos
---
> PC manufacturers have been working to make PCs simpiler and simpiler to put together
>* ZIP(idy do da zipidy day) is Zero Inerstion Force, in normal talk if you have to push really hard it doesn't go there
>* Different generagtions of RAM, random access memory, look different. The notch is mover slightly off center one way or another to prevent them from going in wrong generation slots
> Your're probably over thinking it.
> If you played with legos, mega blocks, or similar as a kid you can build a pc.
>* They even have the same instructions.
> The CPU is one of the most expensive and easist to break so here's a video to help you visualize it
>* This is the Installing AMD Ryzen CPU and Wraith Spire Cooler by Roy Chua (The wraith cooler is one of the more complicated installs I've seen so heres the hard one)
> [Installing AMD Ryzen CPU and Wraith Spire Cooler by Roy Chua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw3ZY5rKkOk)
>* As unatural as it sound paperwork is your friend, picture books are adult instructions, and build a PC isn't as hard as the dollar signs make it sound

More Tips and Tricks
---
>* CPU's have a triangle on one corner to make sure you line it up in the socket correctly.
>* You can do it. One of the biggest hurdles to building a PC is the belief that its complicated


Supprising facts
